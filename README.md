### Overview
Our groupâ€™s overall goal for the project was to visually present findings from the World Happiness Report. Each group member chose to focus on a specific aspect of the data:
How happiness is affected based on the social factors that were used to measure the happiness score (Ladder Score).
Deaths and overall life satisfaction measurements related to Covid-19.
Exploring reasons for happiness in some countries and unhappiness in others.
Comparing 2020 with previous years.
